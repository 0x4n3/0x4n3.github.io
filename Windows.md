## Courses I've Taken

* [EXP-301](https://www.offsec.com/documentation/EXP301-syllabus.pdf) by OffSec
  * This course is a great introduction to x86 Windows exploit development. Don't expect anything fancy, but this is a must-have if you are new to the field.
* [EXP-401](https://www.offensive-security.com/awe/EXP401_syllabus.pdf) by OffSec
  * The gold standard in terms of modern Windows exploit development and security research. If you have the opportunity to attend this course, do so by all means.
